# PlotBehaviourTrees
A simple framework for events and behaviour trees.

This framework is designed to facilitate defining a narrative and behaviour for non player characters, 
in both JavaScript for HTML5 games and in C#, probably for Unity games.

This framework is explained in a detailed video and blog post [coming soon].
